School management system

Purpose
I wanted to build school management system, this is not to manage everything about the school, But few important things. It involves object-oriented concepts to maintain “Students, Teachers and Funds”. So basically, it is money management system for a school.

What it does:
-	keep the track of student total fees including fees already paid as well as fees balanced.
-	Teacher’s salary.

Contains:
So, school class is going to have objects of student as well as teachers. I can start building from ground work by creating student class first.

School class:
-	Teachers.
-	Students.
-	Total money earned (from student fee).
-	Total money spent (for teacher salary).

Teacher class:
-	Teacher character is going to have an ID as a unique reference.
-	His/her name.
-	Their salary.

Student class:
-	A student will have ID.
-	Name.
-	Class/grade/standard.
-	Fees paid.
-	Total fees.
